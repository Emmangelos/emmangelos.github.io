Backend programming is not my thing. 
However, being a technophobic, easily distracted, wilderness-loving <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">linguist</span> biologist, I am proud to say I have completed the bare minimum of Codecademy lessons to make a "site". 
This site, so far, is built using the Ruby gem [Jekyll][jekyll-talk]. 


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
