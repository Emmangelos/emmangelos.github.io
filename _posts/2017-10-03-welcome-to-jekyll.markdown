Programming is not my thing. 
However, being a technophobic, <strike>90s kid</strike> easily distracted, wilderness-loving biologist, I am proud to say I have completed the bare minimum of Codecademy lessons to make a "site". 
I've heard web design and backend described as "super easy", but being proficient in several human languages, soldering, and cooking didn't help me ONE BIT. Even a smattering of Python and bash/C didn't get me far. So, I'm in the process of learning full-stack design, hacking it out and wondering how literal children can do this without even setting down their fidget spinner. 

This site, so far, is built using the Ruby gem [Jekyll][jekyll-talk].
